# DM-Bot
ik this is skiddy but I needed one of these for something so I made it and decided to post it on github

Sends a message to every person in your friends list

**Note: To avoid being ratelimited or limited I made the request delay 2.5 seconds so it might take a while to dm all your friends**

**Setup Guide**

1. Make sure you have python
2. Put your token in settings.json
3. Open setup.bat
4. Open main.py
